This is simply a follow-along project created during the pluralsight course "Building a JavaScript Development Environment" as I introduced myself to some of the practices and tooling in the Node/Express ecosystem; having stagnated so long in the LAMP stack environment.

While written by me, none of this code is of my own innovation, nor is it intended to be portrayed as such.
